This will first scrape for current emojis being listed on discordmoji.com. Then, it will download them to a directory adjacent to `discordMoji` called `scraped_emojis`

There are currently over 5000 emojis on this site as of this commit. A total of ~100M.

This script is written to be somewhat respectful of the host server. So, it will take a while for all of them to download (Over 1.5 hours.) Don't whine to me about it. It was the right thing to do.

Go outside for a little bit or something. ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ»
